The command line utility requires the WWW::Curl module to be installed. It takes 2 arguments. The first is the Gmail user name. 

The second argument is the password list file. The passwd file must end with .list only because I wanted people to be conscious 

of what files they were passing. 


The UI requires a few more deps. For all of you uncomfortable with installing modules from the command line or from source via 

cpan.org's tarball pkg's, there is a makefile to automate the installation of the deps. The Build.sh file removes all manual intervention.

Run it once and thats it.


NOTE: I have written this on my Gentoo box and am uncertain of anything pertaining to MS Windows. Also, if you're going to try and BF my

email... GOOD LUCK! My password is strong and you'll never crack it ;)
